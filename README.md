# Conic Sections
A way of visualizing conic sections with only an expanding circle and line.

Equivalent to the zth layer of a cone and a plane intersection. The cone's cross-section is the circle, and the plane's cross-section is a line.

# Parabola

Notice that the distance between the end of the circle and the line is held constant. This is because the plane is parallel to the cone's edge.

# Ellipse

If the line moves "faster" than the circle, then eventually the parabola will "close in" upon itself and form an ellipse.

# Hyperbola
The problem with the hyperbola is that we would have to view it in the plane perpendicular to the way which the circle and line are being drawn. So if we attempt it, we only get a straight line, as that is what it would look like from above.
